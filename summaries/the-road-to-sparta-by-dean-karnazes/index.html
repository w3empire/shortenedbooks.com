<p><strong>Example:</strong> Karnazes describes moments of mental clarity and euphoria he experiences during long-distance runs. He explains how the rhythmic motion of running can quiet the mind and create a state of flow, allowing for deeper self-reflection and enhanced focus.</p>
<p><strong>Practical exercise:</strong> Engage in a mindfulness practice during a physical activity, such as focusing on your breath or body sensations while running. Observe any shifts in your mental state and how they influence your overall performance and well-being.</p>
