            </figure><div class="content post__content clearfix"><p>&ldquo;Designed to Move: The Science-Backed Program to Fight Sitting Disease and Enjoy Lifelong Health&rdquo; by Joan Vernikos is a groundbreaking book that explores the detrimental effects of a sedentary lifestyle and provides a science-backed program to counteract the negative impact of sitting.</p>
<p>Dr. Vernikos, a former director of NASA&rsquo;s Life Sciences Division, delves into the concept of &ldquo;sitting disease&rdquo; and offers practical solutions to improve health and well-being.</p>
<p>The main intention of the author is to raise awareness about the harmful consequences of prolonged sitting and empower individuals to incorporate movement into their daily lives.</p>
<p>By examining the physiological responses of the human body to inactivity and the effects of gravity, Dr. Vernikos highlights the importance of regular movement and its role in maintaining optimal health and vitality.</p>
<h2 id="idea-1-the-effects-of-gravity-on-the-body">Idea 1: The Effects of Gravity on the Body</h2>
<p>The first big idea is the crucial role of gravity in maintaining health and well-being. The author explains how our bodies have evolved to function optimally under the influence of gravity and how being sedentary disrupts this natural balance. When we sit for extended periods, we deprive our bodies of the constant gravitational forces they require for proper functioning.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> When we stand up and move, gravity exerts a beneficial stress on our bodies, stimulating physiological processes that contribute to cardiovascular health, muscle strength, and bone density. However, when we sit for long periods, these beneficial stresses are absent, leading to a decline in overall well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Practical exercise:</strong> Incorporate short periods of standing and movement into your daily routine. Set reminders to stand up every hour and take a short walk or perform light stretching exercises. This simple act of interrupting sedentary behavior can have significant positive effects on your health.</p>
<h2 id="idea-2-the-dangers-of-the-sitting-disease">Idea 2: The Dangers of the Sitting Disease</h2>
<p>Dr. Vernikos introduces the concept of &ldquo;sitting disease,&rdquo; a term coined to describe the adverse health effects associated with prolonged sitting. Research has shown that excessive sitting increases the risk of various chronic conditions, including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and even certain types of cancer.</p>
<p>The author explains the underlying mechanisms through which sitting disease affects our bodies at a cellular and molecular level.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> When we sit for extended periods, our muscles become inactive, leading to a decrease in metabolic activity. This inactivity affects the body&rsquo;s ability to process glucose and fats effectively, resulting in higher blood sugar levels and increased fat storage. Over time, this can contribute to the development of chronic conditions such as insulin resistance and obesity.</p>
<p><strong>Practical exercise:</strong> Break up long periods of sitting by incorporating movement breaks. Stand up and perform simple exercises such as squats, lunges, or leg lifts to activate your muscles and increase blood flow. By doing so, you can mitigate the negative effects of sitting disease and improve your overall health.</p>
<h2 id="idea-3-the-importance-of-spontaneous-movement">Idea 3: The Importance of Spontaneous Movement</h2>
<p>In the book, Dr. Vernikos emphasizes the significance of spontaneous movement throughout the day. While regular exercise is beneficial, it is equally essential to engage in frequent low-intensity movement. Spontaneous movement refers to the natural, everyday activities we perform, such as walking, gardening, or household chores.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Simple activities like taking the stairs instead of the elevator or walking to the nearby grocery store instead of driving can significantly increase our daily movement levels. These small but consistent actions add up and contribute to improved health outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Practical exercise:</strong> Look for opportunities to incorporate more movement into your daily routine. Choose activities that you enjoy and that align with your lifestyle. Take short walks during breaks, engage in active hobbies, or consider using a standing desk to encourage more movement throughout the day.</p>
<h2 id="idea-4-the-power-of-microgravity">Idea 4: The Power of Microgravity</h2>
<p>Dr. Vernikos discusses the concept of microgravity and its impact on our bodies. Microgravity refers to the conditions experienced by astronauts in space, where the effects of gravity are significantly reduced. By studying the physiological changes in astronauts during space missions, researchers have gained valuable insights into the importance of gravity on human health.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Extended stays in space lead to significant muscle and bone loss, cardiovascular deconditioning, and other adverse effects. However, astronauts who engage in regular exercise and movement while in space mitigate many of these negative consequences.</p>
<p><strong>Practical exercise:</strong> While most of us won&rsquo;t experience microgravity, we can mimic some of its effects by engaging in exercises that simulate resistance and stress on our bodies. Strength training, using resistance bands, or performing bodyweight exercises are effective ways to introduce beneficial stresses similar to those experienced in microgravity.</p>
<h2 id="idea-5-movement-as-a-prescription">Idea 5: Movement as a Prescription</h2>
<p>The book highlights the potential of movement as a preventive and therapeutic tool for promoting lifelong health. Dr. Vernikos argues that movement should be viewed as a powerful prescription that can improve physical and mental well-being, reduce the risk of chronic diseases, and enhance longevity.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Studies have shown that regular movement and exercise can lower blood pressure, improve insulin sensitivity, enhance cognitive function, boost mood, and even reduce the risk of premature death. Movement becomes a non-pharmacological intervention that has profound effects on overall health.</p>
<p><strong>Practical exercise:</strong> Make movement a priority in your life by scheduling regular physical activity. Find activities that you enjoy and make them a consistent part of your routine. Whether it&rsquo;s walking, cycling, swimming, or dancing, engaging in movement regularly is an investment in your long-term health.</p>
<h2 id="idea-6-movement-for-all-ages">Idea 6: Movement for All Ages</h2>
<p>The book emphasizes that movement is crucial for individuals of all ages, from children to older adults. Dr. Vernikos highlights the importance of cultivating movement habits from an early age to promote optimal growth and development. Additionally, she discusses how movement can counteract the effects of aging and improve quality of life in older adults.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Children who engage in regular physical activity not only develop stronger muscles and bones but also enhance their cognitive abilities, attention span, and social skills. In older adults, movement helps maintain muscle strength, balance, and flexibility, reducing the risk of falls and preserving independence.</p>
<p><strong>Practical exercise:</strong> Encourage children to engage in active play and participate in sports. Foster a culture of movement within your family by planning outings that involve physical activities. For older adults, incorporate exercises that target balance, coordination, and strength into their routine. Activities like yoga, tai chi, or resistance training can provide numerous benefits.</p>
<h2 id="idea-7-the-power-of-standing">Idea 7: The Power of Standing</h2>
<p>The book emphasizes the importance of standing as an antidote to the detrimental effects of sitting. Dr. Vernikos explains how standing engages muscles, activates circulation, and promotes healthy posture. She encourages individuals to integrate more standing time into their daily lives.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Standing desks have gained popularity as a means to counteract the negative effects of sitting. By alternating between sitting and standing throughout the workday, individuals can reduce sedentary behavior and improve their overall health.</p>
<p><strong>Practical exercise:</strong> Consider investing in a standing desk or creating a makeshift standing workstation. Start by standing for short periods and gradually increase your standing time. Incorporate movements such as shifting weight, stretching, or performing gentle exercises while standing to maximize the benefits.</p>
<h2 id="idea-8-movement-and-brain-health">Idea 8: Movement and Brain Health</h2>
<p>Dr. Vernikos explores the intricate relationship between movement and brain health. Regular physical activity has been shown to enhance cognitive function, improve memory, and protect against age-related cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Research has demonstrated that exercise increases the production of growth factors in the brain, which support the growth of new neurons and the formation of connections between them. This neuroplasticity contributes to improved cognitive function and overall brain health.</p>
<p><strong>Practical exercise:</strong> Engage in aerobic exercises that elevate the heart rate and increase blood flow to the brain. Activities like brisk walking, jogging, cycling, or dancing are excellent choices. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week to reap the cognitive benefits.</p>
<h2 id="idea-9-movement-and-sleep-quality">Idea 9: Movement and Sleep Quality</h2>
<p>The book explores the relationship between movement and sleep quality. Dr. Vernikos explains how regular physical activity can improve sleep patterns, enhance sleep quality, and reduce the incidence of sleep disorders.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Engaging in exercise during the day helps regulate the body&rsquo;s internal clock, known as the circadian rhythm. This synchronization promotes the natural sleep-wake cycle, making it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep throughout the night.</p>
<p><strong>Practical exercise:</strong> Establish a consistent exercise routine, preferably during the daytime. Avoid vigorous exercise close to bedtime, as it can have a stimulating effect. Instead, focus on relaxation exercises such as yoga or gentle stretching in the evening to wind down and prepare your body for restful sleep.</p>
<h2 id="idea-10-the-social-aspect-of-movement">Idea 10: The Social Aspect of Movement</h2>
<p>Dr. Vernikos emphasizes the social component of movement and its impact on overall well-being. Engaging in physical activity with others fosters social connections, reduces feelings of loneliness and isolation, and promotes a sense of belonging.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Joining group fitness classes, participating in team sports, or walking with friends and family not only provides the benefits of movement but also creates opportunities for social interaction and support.</p>
<p><strong>Practical exercise:</strong> Seek out community-based activities or local clubs that align with your interests. Engage in group exercise classes, sports leagues, or walking groups to combine the benefits of movement with social connection.</p>
<h2 id="who-is-this-book-recommended-for">Who is this Book Recommended For?</h2>
