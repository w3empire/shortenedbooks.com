            </figure><div class="content post__content clearfix"><p>&ldquo;It Takes What It Takes: How to Think Neutrally and Gain Control of Your Life&rdquo; is a self-help book co-authored by Trevor Moawad, a renowned mental conditioning coach, and Andy Staples, a sports journalist.</p>
<p>The book explores the power of neutral thinking and its profound impact on one&rsquo;s life and performance. Moawad draws upon his experience working with elite athletes, CEOs, and military personnel to present a unique approach to achieving personal and professional success.</p>
<p>The central theme of the book revolves around the idea that the way we think directly influences our actions and outcomes. Moawad argues that by adopting a neutral mindset, individuals can overcome negative thinking patterns, eliminate self-doubt, and take control of their lives.</p>
<p>The authors emphasize the importance of recognizing the factors that are within our control and shifting our focus towards them rather than dwelling on uncontrollable external circumstances.</p>
<p>Through a series of anecdotes, case studies, and practical exercises, Moawad and Staples guide readers through the process of developing a neutral mindset. They emphasize the significance of self-awareness, self-reflection, and intentional thinking in fostering personal growth and achieving peak performance.</p>
<p>The book also delves into the concept of &ldquo;response management,&rdquo; encouraging readers to focus on how they respond to situations rather than solely relying on external motivation or inspiration.</p>
<h2 id="idea-1-the-power-of-neutral-thinking">Idea 1: The Power of Neutral Thinking</h2>
<p>Neutral thinking forms the foundation of the book&rsquo;s philosophy. The authors argue that neutral thinking allows individuals to detach themselves from emotional highs and lows and maintain a balanced perspective. By adopting a neutral mindset, one can avoid being overwhelmed by negative thoughts and emotions, enabling clearer decision-making and enhanced performance.</p>
<p>The book provides practical strategies for embracing neutral thinking, such as reframing negative thoughts, maintaining a forward-focused mindset, and recognizing the controllable aspects of any situation.</p>
<h2 id="idea-2-recognizing-the-controllables">Idea 2: Recognizing the Controllables</h2>
<p>Another key idea in the book is the importance of identifying and focusing on the controllable elements in one&rsquo;s life. Moawad and Staples stress that there are aspects of any situation that individuals can influence or control, and by directing their attention and energy towards these controllables, they can make meaningful progress.</p>
<p>This concept is particularly relevant when facing challenges or setbacks, as it allows individuals to shift their focus from what they cannot control to what they can control, leading to a more empowered and proactive approach to problem-solving.</p>
<h2 id="idea-3-the-impact-of-language">Idea 3: The Impact of Language</h2>
<p>Language plays a significant role in shaping our thoughts and actions, and this idea is explored in depth within the book. The authors highlight the importance of using neutral, solution-oriented language to reinforce a neutral mindset.</p>
<p>By avoiding negative self-talk and focusing on constructive language, individuals can reframe their thoughts and cultivate a positive internal dialogue.</p>
<p>The book provides practical exercises and strategies for developing effective communication skills and harnessing the power of language to support personal growth and success.</p>
<h2 id="idea-4-the-power-of-habitual-excellence">Idea 4: The Power of Habitual Excellence</h2>
<p>Building on the idea of neutral thinking, the book emphasizes the role of habits in achieving excellence. Moawad and Staples contend that excellence is not a result of occasional bursts of effort but rather a product of consistent, intentional actions.</p>
<p>They encourage readers to develop a mindset of habitual excellence by cultivating positive daily habits, maintaining discipline, and embracing a growth-oriented mindset. By making excellence a habit, individuals can optimize their performance and achieve long-term success.</p>
<h2 id="idea-5-the-role-of-self-awareness">Idea 5: The Role of Self-Awareness</h2>
<p>Self-awareness is a crucial element in personal and professional development, and it is extensively explored in the book. Moawad and Staples argue that self-awareness allows individuals to understand their strengths, weaknesses, and behavioral patterns, enabling them to make informed decisions and improve their performance.</p>
<p>The authors provide practical exercises and strategies for developing self-awareness, including mindfulness techniques, reflection, and seeking feedback from others.</p>
<h2 id="idea-6-response-management">Idea 6: Response Management</h2>
<p>The concept of response management forms a significant part of the book&rsquo;s teachings. Moawad and Staples emphasize that individuals have control over their responses to situations, even when they cannot control the circumstances themselves.</p>
<p>By focusing on managing their responses, individuals can adapt to challenges, maintain composure under pressure, and make better decisions. The book provides strategies for developing response management skills, including visualization techniques, mental rehearsal, and deliberate practice.</p>
<h2 id="idea-7-the-impact-of-the-environment">Idea 7: The Impact of the Environment</h2>
<p>The environment in which individuals operate has a profound influence on their mindset and behavior. Moawad and Staples stress the importance of creating a supportive and conducive environment that fosters positive thinking and growth.</p>
<p>They explore the concept of &ldquo;neutral thinking ecosystems,&rdquo; where individuals surround themselves with like-minded individuals who reinforce a neutral mindset and encourage personal growth. The book provides guidance on how to create and maintain such environments in various aspects of life, including personal relationships, workplace settings, and team dynamics.</p>
<h2 id="idea-8-overcoming-fear-and-doubt">Idea 8: Overcoming Fear and Doubt</h2>
<p>Fear and doubt are common obstacles that hinder personal growth and success. Moawad and Staples address these challenges and provide strategies for overcoming them. They emphasize the importance of reframing fear and doubt as opportunities for growth rather than allowing them to paralyze or limit individuals.</p>
<p>The book guides readers through techniques for managing fear and doubt, such as developing a growth mindset, visualizing success, and embracing discomfort as a catalyst for progress.</p>
<h2 id="idea-9-the-impact-of-visualization">Idea 9: The Impact of Visualization</h2>
<p>Visualization is a powerful tool explored in the book to help individuals achieve their goals. Moawad and Staples explain how mental rehearsal and visualization techniques can enhance performance by improving focus, confidence, and mental clarity.</p>
<p>They provide practical exercises and strategies for incorporating visualization into daily routines, highlighting its effectiveness in preparing for challenging situations and maximizing potential.</p>
<h2 id="idea-10-the-pursuit-of-mastery">Idea 10: The Pursuit of Mastery</h2>
<p>The final idea discussed in the book is the pursuit of mastery. Moawad and Staples emphasize that personal growth and excellence are ongoing journeys rather than finite destinations. They advocate for embracing a growth mindset, setting challenging goals, and committing to continuous improvement.</p>
<p>The authors provide guidance on how to cultivate a mindset of mastery, including strategies for setting meaningful goals, developing resilience, and seeking out opportunities for learning and growth.</p>
<h2 id="bonus-section-harnessing-neutral-thinking-practical-exercises-for-personal-empowerment">Bonus Section: Harnessing Neutral Thinking: Practical Exercises for Personal Empowerment</h2>
<p>Here are some practical exercises inspired by the book &ldquo;It Takes What It Takes: How to Think Neutrally and Gain Control of Your Life&rdquo; by Trevor Moawad and Andy Staples that can help you apply the principles discussed:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Identify and challenge negative thoughts</strong>: Pay close attention to your inner dialogue and identify any negative thoughts or self-limiting beliefs. Once you notice them, challenge their validity and replace them with more neutral or positive alternatives. Practice this exercise daily to reframe your thinking patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Neutralize setbacks</strong>: When faced with setbacks or failures, train yourself to think neutrally about them. Instead of dwelling on the negative aspects, focus on the opportunities for growth and learning that they present. This exercise can help you maintain resilience and bounce back quickly from setbacks.</li>
<li><strong>Cultivate gratitude</strong>: Develop a daily gratitude practice where you consciously reflect on things you are grateful for. This exercise helps shift your mindset towards positivity and enhances your ability to think neutrally by focusing on the good in your life.</li>
<li><strong>Visualize success</strong>: Use visualization techniques to imagine yourself succeeding in various areas of your life. Visualize the specific steps and actions you need to take to achieve your goals. By regularly engaging in this exercise, you can program your mind to think neutrally about success and build a strong belief in your abilities.</li>
<li><strong>Practice self-awareness</strong>: Take time each day to reflect on your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. Notice any patterns that arise and evaluate whether they are helping or hindering your progress. By increasing your self-awareness, you can identify areas where you need to apply neutral thinking and make necessary adjustments.</li>
<li><strong>Build a positive affirmation routine</strong>: Create a list of positive affirmations that align with the principles of neutral thinking and your personal goals. Repeat these affirmations daily, especially during challenging situations, to reinforce a neutral mindset and cultivate self-belief.</li>
<li><strong>Engage in mental rehearsals</strong>: Imagine yourself successfully navigating difficult situations or overcoming obstacles. Mentally rehearse your responses and actions, focusing on thinking neutrally and making effective decisions. This exercise enhances your mental preparedness and helps you approach challenging situations with a neutral mindset.</li>
<li><strong>Surround yourself with positive influences</strong>: Evaluate your social circle and ensure you are surrounded by individuals who support your growth and think neutrally. Engage in meaningful conversations and seek advice from those who embody the principles discussed in the book. This exercise helps reinforce neutral thinking through external influences.</li>
</ol>
<p>Incorporate these exercises into your daily routine and practice them regularly to develop a neutral thinking mindset and gain control of your life.</p>
<h2 id="who-is-this-book-recommended-for">Who is this Book Recommended For?</h2>
<p>&ldquo;It Takes What It Takes&rdquo; is recommended for individuals seeking personal and professional growth, as well as those interested in sports psychology and performance optimization. Athletes, coaches, business professionals, and anyone looking to improve their mindset and achieve their goals can benefit from the insights and practical strategies presented in the book.</p>
<p>The principles and techniques outlined by Moawad and Staples can be applied to various areas of life, making the book relevant and valuable to a wide range of readers.</p>
<h2 id="review-of-the-book">Review of the Book</h2>
<p>&ldquo;It Takes What It Takes&rdquo; presents a refreshing and practical approach to mindset and personal development. The book effectively combines real-life anecdotes and case studies with actionable strategies, making it engaging and accessible to readers. Moawad&rsquo;s expertise in mental conditioning shines through, and his insights are complemented by Staples&rsquo; skillful storytelling.</p>
<p>One of the book&rsquo;s strengths lies in its emphasis on personal responsibility and control. By encouraging readers to focus on what they can control rather than being consumed by external factors, the authors empower individuals to take charge of their lives and make meaningful changes. The practical exercises and techniques provided throughout the book further enhance its value, as readers can actively apply the concepts and see tangible results.</p>
<p>But some people may find the book&rsquo;s heavy emphasis on sports examples and athlete anecdotes less relatable if they are not involved in sports or athletics. While the principles discussed are applicable to various domains, a more diverse range of case studies and examples could have made the book even more inclusive and appealing to a broader audience.</p>
<p>Plus, the book occasionally repeats certain concepts and ideas, which might be perceived as redundant by some readers. However, this repetition also serves as a reinforcement of key messages and ensures that readers fully grasp the core principles.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>&ldquo;It Takes What It Takes: How to Think Neutrally and Gain Control of Your Life&rdquo; offers valuable insights and practical strategies for individuals seeking personal growth, enhanced performance, and mindset optimization. The book&rsquo;s emphasis on neutral thinking, self-awareness, response management, and the power of habits provides readers with a framework for achieving excellence in various areas of life.</p>
<p>Despite its occasional sports-centric focus and repetition, the book&rsquo;s impact lies in its ability to empower individuals to take control of their thoughts, actions, and outcomes. If you embrace neutral thinking and apply the principles outlined in the book, you can gain greater control over your life and strive towards personal and professional success.</p>
