<p>While the book is comprehensive and thorough in its exploration of cancer, it is worth noting that the scientific content can be challenging for readers without a scientific background.</p>
<p>Some readers may find certain sections dense or overwhelming, particularly when delving into intricate biological mechanisms. However, the author&rsquo;s efforts to simplify complex concepts are evident, and he strikes a commendable balance between scientific accuracy and accessibility.</p>
<p>In terms of improvement, it would have been beneficial to include more diverse perspectives and experiences within the book. While Mukherjee highlights the stories of individuals from different walks of life, there is room for further representation of the experiences of marginalized communities and underserved populations.</p>
<p>Additionally, the book primarily focuses on cancer in the context of Western societies, and it would have been valuable to explore the global impact of the disease in greater depth.</p>
