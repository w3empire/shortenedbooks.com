            </figure><div class="content post__content clearfix"><p>&ldquo;Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative&rdquo; by Austin Kleon is a self-help book that explores the process of creativity and offers practical advice to aspiring artists and creators.</p>
<p>The author emphasizes the importance of embracing influence, embracing one&rsquo;s own creativity, and finding inspiration in unexpected places. Through a series of ten concise and engaging chapters, Kleon shares his insights and encourages readers to unlock their creative potential.</p>
<p>Kleon&rsquo;s intention with this book is to challenge the notion of originality and inspire readers to borrow ideas, techniques, and concepts from others while adding their own unique perspective.</p>
<p>He believes that nothing is truly original and that all creativity is essentially a remix of existing ideas. By &ldquo;stealing&rdquo; from various sources and blending them with personal experiences and interpretations, individuals can create something new and meaningful.</p>
<p>The book incorporates elements of visual art and design with colorful illustrations and handwritten text, making it visually appealing and accessible. Kleon draws inspiration from diverse disciplines, including literature, music, the visual arts, and technology, to demonstrate how creativity can be nurtured and harnessed in today&rsquo;s digital age.</p>
<h2 id="idea-1-embrace-influence">Idea 1: Embrace Influence</h2>
<p>Kleon&rsquo;s first idea revolves around the concept of embracing influence as a vital part of the creative process. He encourages readers to acknowledge and explore the works of artists they admire, learning from their techniques, ideas, and perspectives.</p>
<p>Kleon emphasizes that by being open to influence, artists can develop their own unique style and voice. He states, &ldquo;Influence is about combining what you&rsquo;ve experienced with what you bring to the table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To illustrate this idea, Kleon shares the example of renowned filmmaker Quentin Tarantino. Tarantino is well-known for drawing inspiration from a wide range of films, genres, and directors. He takes existing ideas and recontextualizes them to create something distinctively his own.</p>
<p>Kleon emphasizes that by acknowledging and embracing the influence of others, artists can find their creative footing and develop their own artistic identity.</p>
<h2 id="idea-2-use-your-hands">Idea 2: Use Your Hands</h2>
<p>In the digital age, where technology and screens dominate much of our lives, Kleon highlights the importance of using our hands to create. He suggests that physical engagement with materials, whether through drawing, crafting, or writing by hand, can stimulate creativity and enhance the creative process.</p>
<p>Kleon states, &ldquo;The computer is really good for editing your ideas, and it&rsquo;s really good for getting your ideas ready for publishing out into the world, but it&rsquo;s not really good for generating ideas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kleon cites the example of poet and songwriter Leonard Cohen, who famously wrote his lyrics on a typewriter or by hand. Cohen believed that the physical act of writing with pen and paper connected him to his words on a deeper level. By using our hands, we engage our senses and tap into a more intuitive and authentic creative process.</p>
<h2 id="idea-3-steal-like-an-artist">Idea 3: Steal Like an Artist</h2>
<p>At the core of Kleon&rsquo;s book is the idea that all creative work is built upon the foundation of existing ideas. He argues that rather than trying to be completely original, artists should embrace the act of &ldquo;stealing&rdquo; from various sources. Kleon encourages readers to curate their influences, select what resonates with them, and combine these influences to create something new.</p>
<p>The author emphasizes the importance of transforming borrowed ideas into something that reflects one&rsquo;s unique perspective.</p>
<p>He states, &ldquo;You are, in fact, a mashup of what you choose to let into your life.&rdquo; Kleon believes that by openly acknowledging and remixing existing ideas, artists can create work that is both authentic and innovative.</p>
<h2 id="idea-4-side-projects-and-hobbies">Idea 4: Side Projects and Hobbies</h2>
<p>Kleon advocates for the pursuit of side projects and hobbies as a means to fuel creativity. He suggests that by engaging in activities unrelated to one&rsquo;s primary creative work, individuals can find new inspiration and perspectives.</p>
<p>Exploring different interests and pursuing diverse hobbies can lead to unexpected breakthroughs and fresh ideas.</p>
<p>Kleon shares the example of writer and illustrator Brian Eno, who used to carry a small notebook with him to jot down ideas while waiting in airports. These notes later became the foundation for some of Eno&rsquo;s most celebrated works. By indulging in side projects and hobbies, artists can foster a playful and exploratory mindset, allowing ideas to flourish.</p>
<h2 id="idea-5-be-boring">Idea 5: Be Boring</h2>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, Kleon argues that boredom is an essential ingredient for creativity. He believes that in today&rsquo;s fast-paced and distraction-filled world, embracing boredom can provide space for new ideas to emerge.</p>
<p>By disconnecting from constant stimulation and embracing moments of solitude and reflection, artists can tap into their inner thoughts and creative wellspring.</p>
<p>Kleon draws inspiration from the routines of influential artists such as composer Igor Stravinsky and writer Haruki Murakami, who both adhered to structured daily rituals. By establishing consistent habits and allocating time for quiet contemplation, individuals can create a fertile environment for creativity to thrive.</p>
<h2 id="idea-6-share-your-work">Idea 6: Share Your Work</h2>
<p>In the age of social media and digital platforms, Kleon emphasizes the importance of sharing one&rsquo;s creative work with the world. He suggests that by embracing the act of sharing, artists can receive valuable feedback, gain exposure, and connect with a like-minded community.</p>
<p>Kleon encourages readers to document their creative process and share it openly, whether through blogs, social media, or personal websites. He argues that sharing work, even if it is not yet perfect, is crucial for growth and development as an artist.</p>
<p>By inviting others to witness the journey, artists can receive support, inspiration, and constructive criticism that can help refine their work.</p>
<h2 id="idea-7-be-mindful-of-time">Idea 7: Be Mindful of Time</h2>
<p>Kleon highlights the significance of time management and the conscious allocation of creative energy. He advises readers to be mindful of the time they spend on various activities and to prioritize their creative pursuits.</p>
<p>By setting boundaries, establishing routines, and eliminating distractions, individuals can create focused and uninterrupted blocks of time for their creative work.</p>
<p>Kleon acknowledges that creativity requires dedication and discipline. He emphasizes the need to protect one&rsquo;s time and avoid being consumed by mindless activities that do not contribute to personal growth or creative development. By being intentional with time, artists can make significant progress and produce their best work.</p>
<h2 id="idea-8-cultivate-your-community">Idea 8: Cultivate Your Community</h2>
<p>Building a supportive and inspiring community is crucial for any creative individual. Kleon suggests that artists should actively seek out like-minded individuals who can provide feedback, offer encouragement, and challenge their ideas. He emphasizes the importance of connecting with others who share similar passions and creative goals.</p>
<p>Kleon encourages readers to attend events, join workshops, and participate in communities that foster creative collaboration.</p>
<p>By surrounding oneself with a diverse range of people, artists can gain fresh perspectives, find accountability partners, and form valuable relationships that can enhance their creative journey.</p>
<h2 id="idea-9-pay-attention-to-what-resonates">Idea 9: Pay Attention to What Resonates</h2>
<p>Kleon advises readers to pay attention to the ideas, themes, and elements that resonate with them. By identifying patterns and common threads in their own creative interests, individuals can gain insight into their unique artistic voice.</p>
<p>Kleon states, &ldquo;The things that stand out the most to you are standing out for a reason: they&rsquo;re connected to your life and your work somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He encourages artists to explore these resonant themes and incorporate them consciously into their work. By following their passions and curiosities, individuals can infuse their creations with authenticity and meaning.</p>
<h2 id="idea-10-embrace-failure-and-iteration">Idea 10: Embrace Failure and Iteration</h2>
<p>In the final idea of the book, Kleon emphasizes the importance of embracing failure as a natural part of the creative process. He encourages readers to view mistakes and setbacks as opportunities for growth and learning. Kleon suggests that iteration is key to refining one&rsquo;s work and achieving creative breakthroughs.</p>
<p>He draws inspiration from the iterative approach of Pixar Animation Studios, where the creative process involves constant experimentation, feedback, and refinement.</p>
<p>Kleon encourages artists to adopt a similar mindset, embracing failure as a stepping stone towards improvement and, ultimately, success.</p>
<h2 id="who-is-this-book-recommended-for">Who is this Book Recommended For?</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Steal Like an Artist&rdquo; is recommended for anyone seeking inspiration and guidance on the creative process. The book is particularly valuable for aspiring artists, writers, musicians, and creators who may feel stuck or overwhelmed by the pressure to be completely original.</p>
<p>Kleon&rsquo;s approach challenges traditional notions of creativity and encourages individuals to embrace influence, collaborate, and explore diverse interests.</p>
<p>This book is also beneficial for those seeking practical advice on time management, sharing work, and building a creative community. Whether you are a seasoned artist looking for fresh perspectives or a beginner seeking encouragement to embark on a creative journey, &ldquo;Steal Like an Artist&rdquo; provides valuable insights and actionable steps to unlock your creative potential.</p>
<h2 id="review-of-the-book">Review of the Book</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Steal Like an Artist&rdquo; offers a refreshing perspective on creativity and provides practical advice in an engaging and accessible manner. Kleon&rsquo;s writing style is conversational and relatable, making the book easy to read and resonating with readers from various creative backgrounds. The visual elements, including illustrations and handwritten text, add a unique touch and enhance the overall reading experience.</p>
<p>The book&rsquo;s emphasis on embracing influence, borrowing ideas, and remixing existing concepts challenges the common belief that creativity must be completely original. Kleon&rsquo;s approach liberates aspiring artists from the burden of originality, encouraging them to explore and draw inspiration from a diverse range of sources.</p>
<p>The book also provides valuable insights on practical aspects of the creative process, such as time management, sharing work, and building a creative community. Readers at various stages of their creative journeys can use Kleon&rsquo;s advice because it is practical.</p>
<p>While &ldquo;Steal Like an Artist&rdquo; offers many valuable ideas and suggestions, some readers may find that the book lacks in-depth exploration of certain topics. The brevity of each chapter leaves room for further exploration and elaboration on specific concepts.</p>
<p>Additionally, while the book touches on the challenges and setbacks of the creative process, a deeper exploration of overcoming creative blocks and self-doubt would have been beneficial.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative&rdquo; by Austin Kleon is a valuable resource for aspiring artists and creators. By challenging the conventional notions of creativity and embracing the act of borrowing, Kleon empowers individuals to unlock their creative potential. The book offers practical advice, actionable steps, and inspiring examples to guide readers on their creative journey.</p>
<p>Kleon&rsquo;s emphasis on embracing influence, using hands-on approaches, pursuing side projects, sharing work, and cultivating a creative community provides a fresh and relevant perspective on creativity in the digital age. &ldquo;Steal Like an Artist&rdquo; serves as a reminder that creativity is a continuous process of exploration, iteration, and growth.</p>
