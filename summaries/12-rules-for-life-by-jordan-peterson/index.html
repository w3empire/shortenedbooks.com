            </figure><div class="content post__content clearfix"><p>&ldquo;12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos&rdquo; is a self-help book by Canadian clinical psychologist and psychology professor Jordan Peterson. The book was published in 2018 and has since become a bestseller.</p>
<p>In the book, Peterson presents a set of 12 principles that he believes can help individuals lead more fulfilling and meaningful lives.</p>
<p>The book covers a wide range of topics, including psychology, philosophy, religion, and personal development. Peterson&rsquo;s writing style is engaging and thought-provoking, and the book has been praised for its <a href="/summaries/you-are-special-by-fred-rogers/">practical wisdom and insights into human nature</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;12 Rules for Life&rdquo; is a well-written book that offers valuable insights and practical advice for living a more fulfilling and meaningful life.</p>
<h2 id="idea-1-the-12-rules">Idea 1: The 12 Rules</h2>
<p>Here is a list of explanations for each of the 12 principles presented in Jordan Peterson&rsquo;s book &ldquo;12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos&rdquo;:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Stand up straight with your shoulders back:</strong> This principle suggests that good posture can have a positive effect on your physical and mental health, and that adopting a confident and upright posture can help you feel more confident and capable.</li>
<li><strong>Treat yourself like you would someone you are responsible for helping:</strong> This principle encourages individuals to be kind and compassionate towards themselves, and to take care of their own needs in the same way they would care for someone else.</li>
<li><strong>Make friends with people who want the best for you:</strong> This principle advises individuals to surround themselves with supportive and positive people, as these relationships can be beneficial for personal growth and well-being.</li>
<li><strong>Compare yourself with who you were yesterday, not with who someone else is today:</strong> This principle advises individuals to focus on their own progress and development, rather than comparing themselves to others.</li>
<li><strong>Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them:</strong> This principle suggests that setting boundaries and expectations for children can help them develop into responsible and respectful adults.</li>
<li><strong>Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world:</strong> This principle advises individuals to focus on addressing and improving their own lives before attempting to change or criticize the world around them.</li>
<li><strong>Pursue what is meaningful (not what is expedient):</strong> This principle encourages individuals to focus on long-term goals and values, rather than short-term pleasures or convenience.</li>
<li><strong>Tell the truth, or, at least, don&rsquo;t lie:</strong> This principle advises individuals to be honest and truthful in their interactions with others, as lying can lead to negative consequences and undermine trust.</li>
<li><strong>Assume that the person you are listening to might know something you don&rsquo;t:</strong> This principle advises individuals to approach discussions with an open and curious mindset, and to be open to learning from others.</li>
<li><strong>Be precise in your speech:</strong> This principle advises individuals to be clear and concise in their communication, in order to avoid misunderstandings and facilitate effective communication.</li>
<li><strong>Do not bother children when they are skateboarding:</strong> This principle suggests that it is important to respect children&rsquo;s independence and autonomy, and to allow them the space and freedom to pursue their own interests and activities.</li>
<li><strong>Pet a cat when you encounter one on the street:</strong> This principle suggests that taking a moment to engage with and appreciate the natural world, such as by petting a cat, can provide a sense of calm and perspective.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is generally believed that leading a meaningful and fulfilling life can contribute to overall happiness and well-being. The 12 principles presented in Jordan Peterson&rsquo;s book &ldquo;12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos&rdquo; offer practical advice and insights that may be helpful in achieving this goal.</p>
<p>For example, principles such as &ldquo;Stand up straight with your shoulders back,&rdquo; &ldquo;Treat yourself like you would someone you are responsible for helping,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Make friends with people who want the best for you&rdquo; encourage individuals to take care of their physical and mental health, to be kind and compassionate towards themselves, and to surround themselves with supportive and positive people.</p>
<p>Other principles, such as &ldquo;Pursue what is meaningful (not what is expedient)&rdquo; and &ldquo;Be precise in your speech,&rdquo; advise individuals to focus on long-term goals and values, and to communicate effectively, which can help individuals navigate their relationships and daily interactions with greater clarity and purpose.</p>
<p>While following these principles may not guarantee happiness, they may help individuals lead a more fulfilling and meaningful life, which can contribute to overall well-being and satisfaction.</p>
<p>It is important to note, however, that happiness is a complex and subjective experience, and what brings happiness to one person may not be the same for another. It is ultimately up to each individual to determine what brings them happiness and fulfillment.</p>
<h2 id="idea-2-order-and-chaos">Idea 2: Order and chaos</h2>
<p>Jordan Peterson often refers to the concept of yin and yang in his writing and lectures. The yin and yang symbol is a well-known concept in Chinese philosophy and culture, and it represents the duality of opposing yet complementary forces in the universe.</p>
<p>In the yin and yang symbol, the yin (represented by the black portion) represents feminine energy, darkness, passivity, and the unconscious, while the yang (represented by the white portion) represents masculine energy, light, activity, and the conscious.</p>
<p>The two halves of the symbol are interconnected and dependent on each other, and the idea is that balance between the two forces is necessary for harmonious existence.</p>
<p>Peterson uses the yin and yang symbol to illustrate the idea that opposing forces, such as order and chaos, can coexist and interact in a dynamic and interdependent way.</p>
<p>So, it is important to focus on addressing and improving our own lives and circumstances rather than trying to change or control external events or other people.</p>
<p>By focusing on what we can control, we can build resilience, increase our sense of agency, and be better prepared to deal with the challenges and uncertainties that come our way.</p>
<p>He argues that both order and chaos are necessary for growth and development, and that finding a balance between the two is essential for leading a fulfilling and meaningful life.</p>
<h2 id="idea-3-social-hierarchies">Idea 3: Social hierarchies</h2>
<p>In his book &ldquo;12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos,&rdquo; Jordan Peterson discusses a study on lobsters as an example of how social hierarchies can be found in many different types of animal societies.</p>
<p>The study found that lobsters establish a social hierarchy based on size and strength, with larger lobsters dominating smaller ones and gaining access to the best resources.</p>
<p>Peterson uses this example to illustrate the importance of taking personal responsibility and striving for personal growth.</p>
<p>He argues that in human societies, as in lobster societies, individuals who are able to stand up for themselves and assert their place in the social hierarchy are more likely to be successful and to achieve their goals. By contrast, those who are unable to do so may end up at the bottom of the hierarchy and struggle to get ahead.</p>
<p>Peterson suggests that one way for humans to take personal responsibility and improve their standing in the social hierarchy is to work on improving themselves and their abilities.</p>
<p>This can involve things like learning new skills, setting goals, and taking actions to improve their circumstances. By doing these things, individuals can increase their chances of success and improve their standing in the social hierarchy.</p>
<p><strong>Standing up straight with your shoulders back can be a physical manifestation of taking responsibility for your life and being willing to face the challenges that come with it.</strong> It can be a way of showing confidence and being open to new experiences.</p>
<p>However, it is important to remember that this is just one aspect of taking responsibility for your life and that there are many other ways to do so as well. Taking responsibility for your life can also involve setting goals, making decisions, and taking actions that reflect your values and help you to live a fulfilling life.</p>
<p>It can also involve being open to learning and growing as a person, and being willing to take risks and try new things. Ultimately, taking responsibility for your life is about being proactive and actively working towards the things you want in life, rather than simply reacting to the circumstances that come your way.</p>
<h2 id="idea-4-learn-to-take-care-of-yourself">Idea 4: Learn to take care of yourself</h2>
<p>Jordan Peterson emphasizes the importance of considering the long-term consequences of one&rsquo;s actions and taking steps to care for oneself properly.</p>
<p>In his book &ldquo;12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos,&rdquo; he writes that it is important to think about the future and to consider what your life might look like if you were taking good care of yourself.</p>
<p>This can involve things like setting goals, making healthy choices, and taking steps to improve your physical and mental well-being.</p>
<p>By considering the long-term consequences of your actions and taking steps to care for yourself properly, you can create a better future for yourself and set yourself up for success in the long run.</p>
<p>This can involve making choices that may be difficult in the short term, but that will ultimately lead to a better life in the long term. It can also involve being proactive and taking action to improve your circumstances, rather than simply reacting to the challenges that come your way.</p>
<p>Did you know that it&rsquo;s not uncommon for people to prioritize the health and well-being of their pets over their own? In fact, a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that people are more likely to give prescribed medications to their pets than to themselves.</p>
<p>This is often because people view their pets as being dependent on them for care and are more motivated to ensure that their pets receive the treatment they need.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the goal is to create a life that is fulfilling and meaningful, and that is built on a foundation of self-care and personal responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>Self-respect is an important aspect of taking care of oneself and living a fulfilling life.</strong> Having enough self-respect involves valuing oneself and recognizing one&rsquo;s own worth and value as a person. It also involves taking steps to care for oneself physically, mentally, and emotionally.</p>
<p>Taking care of oneself involves doing the little things that can help to improve one&rsquo;s physical and mental well-being. This can include things like eating a healthy diet, getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, and engaging in activities that bring joy and meaning to one&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>It can also involve taking care of one&rsquo;s emotional well-being, such as by seeking help when needed, setting boundaries, and practicing self-care.</p>
<p>By taking care of oneself and having enough self-respect, individuals can build a strong foundation for their overall well-being and set themselves up for success in life. It is an important aspect of living a fulfilling and meaningful life, and it is something that everyone should strive for.</p>
<h2 id="idea-5-do-and-say-things-that-make-you-stronger">Idea 5: Do and say things that make you stronger</h2>
<p>Jordan Peterson encourages individuals to take an honest look at their circumstances and to consider whether they are taking full advantage of the opportunities that are available to them.</p>
<p>He suggests that it is important to work hard and to be proactive in pursuing one&rsquo;s goals and dreams, rather than letting bitterness and resentment hold one back.</p>
<p>It is natural to experience frustration and disappointment at times, but it is important to not let these negative emotions consume you and prevent you from moving forward.</p>
<p>Instead, try to focus on what you can control and take small steps to improve your circumstances. This can involve setting goals, making a plan, and taking actions to move closer to achieving what you want in life.</p>
<p>Jordan Peterson encourages individuals to focus on doing and saying things that will help them to become stronger and more resilient. He suggests that it is important to choose actions and words that align with one&rsquo;s values and that can be spoken of with honor.</p>
<p>Doing and saying things that make you stronger can involve setting and working towards goals, making decisions that reflect your values, and engaging in activities that challenge and stretch you. It can also involve being honest and authentic in your interactions with others, and speaking up for what you believe in.</p>
<p>It is also important to remember that success often comes through hard work and persistence, and that progress may not always be easy or come quickly. By staying focused on your goals and working hard, you can increase your chances of success and make the most of the opportunities that come your way.</p>
<h2 id="idea-6-accept-your-insufficiency">Idea 6: Accept your insufficiency</h2>
<p>In the final chapter of &ldquo;12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos,&rdquo; Jordan Peterson advises individuals to always prioritize their &ldquo;becoming&rdquo; over their &ldquo;current being.&rdquo; By this, he means that it is important to focus on personal growth and development rather than on one&rsquo;s current state or circumstances.</p>
<p>To do this, Peterson suggests that it is necessary to recognize and accept one&rsquo;s insufficiency, or areas where one falls short or is lacking. This can be difficult, as it requires acknowledging that one has weaknesses and areas for improvement.</p>
<p>Yet, by accepting one&rsquo;s insufficiency and being open to learning and growing, individuals can work to continually rectify or improve upon these areas and become the best version of themselves.</p>
<p>In this way, focusing on one&rsquo;s becoming rather than one&rsquo;s current being is a way of staying open to learning and growth, and of working to continually improve oneself and become the best version of oneself that one can be.</p>
<p>This involves taking personal responsibility for one&rsquo;s life, setting goals, and taking actions that reflect one&rsquo;s values. It also involves being open to learning and growing as a person, and being willing to take risks and try new things.</p>
