            </figure><div class="content post__content clearfix"><p>&ldquo;What To Say When You Talk To Your Self&rdquo; is a self-help book written by Shad Helmstetter. The book explores the power of self-talk and its influence on our thoughts, beliefs, and actions.</p>
<p>Helmstetter emphasizes the importance of the messages we give ourselves and how they shape our self-perception, behavior, and overall life outcomes. The author provides practical techniques and exercises to help readers transform their self-talk into a positive and empowering force.</p>
<p>The main themes of the book revolve around the concept of self-talk, which refers to the inner dialogue we have with ourselves on a daily basis. Helmstetter argues that our self-talk can either support or hinder our personal growth and success. He emphasizes that by changing our self-talk, we can reprogram our subconscious mind and create a more positive and fulfilling life.</p>
<p>The author&rsquo;s intention is to empower readers with the knowledge and tools to harness the power of self-talk and use it as a catalyst for personal transformation. Helmstetter aims to help individuals break free from negative self-talk patterns and develop a strong, positive self-image.</p>
<p>Through the book, he guides readers on a journey of self-discovery and self-improvement, offering practical strategies to enhance their self-talk and achieve their goals.</p>
<h2 id="idea-1-the-power-of-self-talk">Idea 1: The Power of Self-Talk</h2>
<p>The book starts by highlighting the immense power of self-talk in shaping our beliefs and actions. Helmstetter explains that the thoughts and messages we repeatedly tell ourselves become ingrained in our subconscious mind, influencing our behavior on a subconscious level.</p>
<p>He emphasizes that by consciously choosing positive and empowering self-talk, we can reprogram our subconscious mind and unlock our true potential.</p>
<p><strong>Practical exercise:</strong> Take a few moments each day to observe your self-talk. Notice any negative or self-limiting thoughts and replace them with positive affirmations. Write down these affirmations and repeat them to yourself throughout the day.</p>
<h2 id="idea-2-the-subconscious-mind">Idea 2: The Subconscious Mind</h2>
<p>Helmstetter delves into the workings of the subconscious mind and its role in our self-talk. He explains that the subconscious mind operates on autopilot, continuously processing the information it receives.</p>
<p>Our self-talk acts as the programming language for the subconscious mind, determining our beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. By becoming aware of our self-talk and consciously choosing positive messages, we can reprogram the subconscious mind to support our goals and desires.</p>
<p><strong>Practical exercise:</strong> Create a list of positive statements and affirmations that reflect the goals and values you want to internalize. Repeat these affirmations daily, particularly before bedtime when the subconscious mind is more receptive to suggestion.</p>
<h2 id="idea-3-the-self-image">Idea 3: The Self-Image</h2>
<p>The author emphasizes the importance of self-image in shaping our reality. Helmstetter explains that our self-image is the mental picture we hold of ourselves, including our beliefs, attitudes, and capabilities.</p>
<p>He asserts that our self-image acts as a filter through which we perceive the world and make decisions. By improving our self-image through positive self-talk, we can expand our sense of possibility and achieve greater success.</p>
<p><strong>Practical exercise:</strong> Create a vision board or a visual representation of your desired self-image. Include images, quotes, and affirmations that align with the person you want to become. Review this visual representation daily and let it influence your self-talk.</p>
<h2 id="idea-4-the-power-of-affirmations">Idea 4: The Power of Affirmations</h2>
<p>Affirmations are a key tool discussed in the book for transforming self-talk. Helmstetter explains that affirmations are positive statements that reinforce desired beliefs and outcomes.</p>
<p>By repeatedly affirming these statements, we can reprogram our subconscious mind and align it with our conscious goals. The author provides guidance on crafting effective affirmations and incorporating them into daily life.</p>
<p><strong>Practical exercise:</strong> Write a list of affirmations that counteract negative self-talk and reflect the positive outcomes you desire. Repeat these affirmations with conviction and emotion, believing in their truth and power.</p>
<h2 id="idea-5-overcoming-limiting-beliefs">Idea 5: Overcoming Limiting Beliefs</h2>
<p>Helmstetter addresses the impact of limiting beliefs on our self-talk and overall potential. He explains that limiting beliefs are negative thoughts or assumptions that hold us back from reaching our goals. The author guides readers in identifying and challenging these limiting beliefs, replacing them with positive, empowering thoughts and beliefs that support personal growth.</p>
<p><strong>Practical exercise:</strong> Identify a limiting belief that has been hindering your progress. Challenge the belief by finding evidence or examples that contradict it. Replace the limiting belief with a positive affirmation that affirms your potential and capability.</p>
<h2 id="idea-6-visualizing-success">Idea 6: Visualizing Success</h2>
<p>Visualization is a powerful technique explored in the book. Helmstetter explains that by vividly imagining our desired outcomes and success, we can strengthen our belief in achieving them. He provides practical guidance on incorporating visualization into daily routines, allowing individuals to program their subconscious minds for success.</p>
<p><strong>Practical exercise:</strong> Find a quiet space and visualize yourself achieving a specific goal or desired outcome. Engage all your senses and immerse yourself in the experience. Repeat this visualization exercise regularly to reinforce positive self-talk and enhance your belief in your abilities.</p>
<h2 id="idea-7-goal-setting-and-action-planning">Idea 7: Goal Setting and Action Planning</h2>
<p>The author emphasizes the importance of goal-setting and action planning in conjunction with positive self-talk.</p>
<p>Helmstetter highlights that while positive self-talk is a catalyst for change, it must be accompanied by clear goals and actionable steps. He provides a framework for effective goal setting and action planning, integrating positive self-talk into the process.</p>
<p><strong>Practical exercise:</strong> Define a specific, measurable goal and break it down into actionable steps. Write down these steps and create a timeline for their completion. As you work on your action plan, reinforce positive self-talk by affirming your progress and capabilities.</p>
<h2 id="idea-8-constructive-feedback-and-self-correction">Idea 8: Constructive Feedback and Self-Correction</h2>
<p>Helmstetter discusses the role of constructive feedback in self-talk. He explains that instead of engaging in self-criticism and negative self-talk when faced with challenges or setbacks, individuals should adopt a more constructive and growth-oriented approach.</p>
<p>By reframing failures as learning opportunities and offering supportive self-talk, individuals can overcome obstacles and continue their journey of self-improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Practical exercise:</strong> The next time you face a setback or make a mistake, approach it with a growth mindset. Instead of berating yourself, focus on the lessons learned and the steps you can take to improve. Offer yourself supportive and constructive self-talk to foster resilience and progress.</p>
<h2 id="idea-9-creating-positive-habits">Idea 9: Creating Positive Habits</h2>
<p>Helmstetter emphasizes the importance of creating positive habits that reinforce positive self-talk. He explains that habits are the building blocks of our daily lives and play a significant role in shaping our thoughts and actions.</p>
<p>By consciously developing habits that align with our goals and values, we can reinforce positive self-talk and create a foundation for lasting change.</p>
<p><strong>Practical exercise:</strong> Identify a habit that is currently hindering your progress or well-being. Replace it with a positive habit that supports your goals and aligns with your values. Repeat this new habit consistently, and reinforce it with positive self-talk.</p>
<h2 id="idea-10-continual-self-improvement">Idea 10: Continual Self-Improvement</h2>
<p>The final idea explores the concept of continual self-improvement through ongoing practice and commitment. Helmstetter emphasizes that positive self-talk is not a one-time fix but a lifelong journey.</p>
<p>He encourages readers to make positive self-talk a daily practice, consistently reinforcing empowering messages and adapting them to new challenges and circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>Practical exercise:</strong> Commit to practicing positive self-talk daily. Set aside a few minutes each day to engage in self-reflection, affirmations, and visualization. Continually refine and adapt your self-talk to support your growth and evolving goals.</p>
<h2 id="who-is-this-book-recommended-for">Who is this Book Recommended For?</h2>

<p>&ldquo;What To Say When You Talk To Your Self&rdquo; presents a compelling and practical approach to transforming self-talk and improving self-image. The book effectively explains the power of self-talk and its influence on our thoughts, beliefs, and actions.</p>
<p>It offers a comprehensive exploration of various techniques such as affirmations, visualization, and goal setting, providing readers with actionable steps to implement positive self-talk in their lives.</p>

<p>The book&rsquo;s structure, with its progression from understanding self-talk to implementing it in daily life, allows for a systematic and practical approach to personal transformation.</p>
<p>But the book&rsquo;s focus on positive self-talk may not fully address the complexities of deeper psychological issues that individuals may face. In such cases, further professional guidance and support may be necessary.</p>

<p>By emphasizing the importance of self-talk and offering actionable steps, the book empowers individuals to take control of their thoughts, beliefs, and actions.</p>
<p>The ideas presented in the book, such as the power of affirmations, visualization, and goal setting, are applicable to various aspects of life, including personal relationships, careers, and overall well-being.</p>
<p>While the book may benefit from a more concise presentation and a deeper exploration of underlying psychological issues, it remains a valuable resource for individuals seeking to improve their self-talk and create a more positive and fulfilling life.</p>
