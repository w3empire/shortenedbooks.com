            </figure><div class="content post__content clearfix"><p>&ldquo;Rethinking Positive Thinking: Inside the New Science of Motivation&rdquo; is a book written by Gabriele Oettingen, a professor of psychology at New York University and the University of Hamburg. The book challenges the idea that positive thinking alone is enough to achieve success and happiness.</p>
<p>In the book, Oettingen presents a method called WOOP (Wish, Outcome, Obstacle, Plan), which is based on the science of motivation and goal-setting.</p>
<p>WOOP is a four-step process that involves visualizing a desired outcome, imagining the obstacles that might get in the way of achieving that outcome, and creating a plan to overcome those obstacles.</p>
<p>Oettingen draws on research from psychology, neuroscience, and sociology to support her argument that positive thinking alone can be counterproductive. She shows that too much positive thinking can lead to complacency and inaction, while a more balanced approach that takes into account potential obstacles and challenges can lead to better outcomes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rethinking Positive Thinking&rdquo; is a thought-provoking book that challenges conventional wisdom about the role of positive thinking in achieving success and happiness. It offers practical advice and tools for anyone who wants to achieve their goals and live a more fulfilling life.</p>
<h2 id="idea-1-positive-thinking-alone-is-not-enough-to-achieve-success-and-happiness">Idea 1: Positive thinking alone is not enough to achieve success and happiness</h2>
<p>This idea may seem counterintuitive at first, as positive thinking has been touted as a powerful tool for success and happiness. However, Oettingen&rsquo;s research demonstrates that positive thinking, while helpful in some contexts, can sometimes hinder our ability to achieve our goals.</p>
<p>The problem with positive thinking is that it can lead to what Oettingen calls &ldquo;mental contrasting.&rdquo; Mental contrasting is the process of thinking positively about a goal or desired outcome without considering the obstacles that might stand in the way of achieving that goal.</p>
<p>Mental contrasting can lead to a false sense of security and actually decrease our motivation to take action. When we don&rsquo;t consider the potential obstacles or challenges, we are less likely to take the necessary steps to overcome them.</p>
<p>Oettingen proposes a solution to this problem: mental contrasting with implementation intentions. Mental contrasting with implementation intentions involves thinking positively about a desired outcome and then identifying and planning for the potential obstacles that may arise. By doing so, we are more likely to take action to overcome those obstacles and achieve our goals.</p>
<p>For example, if your goal is to lose weight, mental contrasting with implementation intentions would involve thinking positively about your desired weight loss outcome and then identifying potential obstacles, such as a lack of time to exercise or difficulty sticking to a healthy diet.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve identified the obstacles, you can create implementation intentions to overcome them, such as scheduling time for exercise or prepping healthy meals in advance.</p>
<p>Oettingen&rsquo;s approach is based on a significant amount of research that demonstrates its effectiveness. She has conducted studies on goal setting and motivation in various contexts, including health, education, and personal finance. Her findings consistently show that mental contrasting with implementation intentions leads to better outcomes than positive thinking alone.</p>
<h2 id="idea-2-imagining-positive-outcomes-without-considering-obstacles-can-actually-hinder-progress-towards-goals">Idea 2: Imagining positive outcomes without considering obstacles can actually hinder progress towards goals</h2>
<p>According to Oettingen, when we imagine a positive outcome without considering obstacles, we may experience a sense of satisfaction and relief that can actually decrease our motivation to take action towards achieving our goals.</p>
<p>This is because our brains perceive the act of imagining a positive outcome as a form of achievement, tricking us into thinking that we have already made progress towards our goal.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when we consider potential obstacles, our brains are forced to confront the reality of the situation and the challenges that we may face. This can be uncomfortable, but it can also be motivating. By acknowledging the obstacles, we are better equipped to come up with strategies to overcome them and take action towards achieving our goals.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean that we should abandon positive thinking altogether. Rather, it means that we should balance our positive thinking with a healthy dose of realism.</p>
<p>We should acknowledge the potential obstacles and challenges we may face but also maintain a positive outlook and focus on the actions we can take to overcome them.</p>
<p>Here are some steps you can take to consider obstacles when pursuing your goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify potential obstacles: Take some time to think about the potential obstacles that could stand in your way. This could include external factors like limited resources or competition or internal factors like self-doubt or a lack of motivation.</li>
<li>Evaluate each obstacle: Once you have identified potential obstacles, evaluate each one to determine how significant a barrier it may be. Some obstacles may be easy to overcome, while others may require more effort and planning.</li>
<li>Brainstorm solutions: For each obstacle, brainstorm possible solutions or strategies to overcome it. This could involve seeking advice from others, developing new skills, or finding creative ways to work around the obstacle.</li>
<li>Create an action plan: Once you have identified potential obstacles and developed strategies to overcome them, create an action plan that outlines the steps you will take to achieve your goal. Be sure to include contingencies for potential obstacles and revisit your plan regularly to make adjustments as needed.</li>
<li>Stay motivated: Remember that obstacles are a natural part of any journey towards a goal and setbacks are not failures. Stay motivated by focusing on your progress and celebrating small wins along the way.</li>
</ul>
<p>By taking these steps to consider potential obstacles, you can develop a more realistic and effective plan for achieving your goals.</p>
<h2 id="idea-3-visualization-techniques-need-to-be-combined-with-practical-planning-in-order-to-achieve-success">Idea 3: Visualization techniques need to be combined with practical planning in order to achieve success</h2>
<p>Positive thinking has been a buzzword for years. It’s not uncommon to hear phrases like &ldquo;just think positively,&rdquo; &ldquo;visualize success,&rdquo; or &ldquo;manifest your dreams.&rdquo; But Gabriele Oettingen believes that while positive thinking and visualization can be helpful in motivating us and keeping us focused on our goals, they can also lead us to overestimate our chances of success.</p>
<p>In other words, if we spend all our time envisioning our desired outcome without putting in the work to make it happen, we’re setting ourselves up for disappointment.</p>
<p>To illustrate this point, let’s say you want to run a marathon. If you spend all your time imagining yourself crossing the finish line and basking in the glory of your achievement, you might feel great in the moment, but you’re not actually doing anything to prepare for the race.</p>
<p>You’re not training, eating right, or taking care of your body. When race day comes, you’re likely to fall short of your goal.</p>
<p>But if you combine visualization techniques with practical planning, you’re more likely to succeed. You can still visualize yourself crossing the finish line, but you’re also setting realistic goals and creating a plan to achieve them. You’re scheduling your training runs, planning your meals, and getting enough sleep. When race day comes, you’re ready to tackle the challenge and have a better chance of success.</p>
<p>So, how can we apply this idea to our own lives? Here are a few tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set realistic goals: Instead of imagining a huge, unrealistic goal, break it down into smaller, achievable steps. This will help you stay motivated and make progress towards your ultimate goal.</li>
<li>Create a plan: Once you have your goals in mind, create a plan to achieve them. This might include scheduling your workouts, setting aside time to work on a project, or breaking a big task into smaller, more manageable pieces.</li>
<li>Visualize success: Visualization can still be a powerful tool, but use it to complement your practical planning. Take a few moments each day to imagine yourself achieving your goals, but then get back to work on the steps you’ve outlined in your plan.</li>
</ul>
<p>Combining visualization techniques with practical planning is the best way to set ourselves up for success. We can stay motivated and focused on our goals while also taking the necessary steps to achieve them.</p>
<p>Yes, of course, you can dream big, but don’t forget to put in the work to make those dreams a reality.</p>
<h2 id="idea-4-woop-wish-outcome-obstacle-plan-is-a-four-step-method-that-can-help-people-achieve-their-goals">Idea 4: WOOP (Wish, Outcome, Obstacle, Plan) is a four-step method that can help people achieve their goals</h2>
<p>Have you ever set a goal for yourself only to find yourself falling short of achieving it? Maybe you wanted to lose weight but found it difficult to stick to a healthy diet or exercise plan. Or perhaps you wanted to improve your grades but struggled to stay focused and motivated.</p>
<p>If so, you&rsquo;re not alone. Many people struggle to achieve their goals and often feel frustrated and disappointed as a result. But never fear—there is a simple four-step method that can help people achieve their goals more effectively. This method is known as &ldquo;WOOP,&rdquo; which stands for Wish, Outcome, Obstacle, and Plan.</p>
<p>So what exactly does &ldquo;WOOP&rdquo; entail, and how can it help you achieve your goals? Let&rsquo;s break it down step by step.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-wish">Step 1: Wish</h3>
<p>The first step in the WOOP method is to identify your wish. What is it that you want to achieve? It could be anything from losing weight to getting a promotion at work to improving your relationships. Whatever it is, be specific about what you want and write it down.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-outcome">Step 2: Outcome</h3>
<p>The second step is to imagine the best possible outcome of achieving your wish. How will your life be different once you&rsquo;ve achieved your goal? Will you feel happier, more confident, or more fulfilled? Visualize this outcome in as much detail as possible, and write it down as well.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-obstacle">Step 3: Obstacle</h3>
<p>The third step is to identify the obstacles that might stand in the way of achieving your goal. These could be external factors such as time constraints or a lack of resources or internal factors such as self-doubt or procrastination. Be honest with yourself about what might hold you back, and write it down.</p>
<h3 id="step-4-plan">Step 4: Plan</h3>
<p>The final step in the WOOP method is to develop a plan for how you will overcome the obstacles and achieve your goal. This plan should be specific, actionable, and realistic. Break your goal down into smaller, manageable steps, and set deadlines for each one. Identify potential roadblocks and come up with strategies for how you will overcome them. Write your plan down and commit to following through on it.</p>
<p>So there you have it—the WOOP method in a nutshell. If you follow these four simple steps, you can increase your chances of achieving your goals and living a more fulfilling life. But why does this method work?</p>
<p>According to Oettingen, the WOOP method is effective because it combines two key elements: positive thinking and realistic planning. By visualizing the best possible outcome of achieving your goal, you create a sense of motivation and excitement that can help propel you forward.</p>
<p>At the same time, by identifying the obstacles that might stand in your way and developing a realistic plan for how you will overcome them, you ensure that you are prepared for the challenges that lie ahead.</p>
<p>So the next time you find yourself struggling to achieve a goal, try using the WOOP method. Who knows—it just might be the key to unlocking your full potential and living the life you&rsquo;ve always wanted.</p>
<h2 id="idea-5-mentally-contrasting-a-desired-outcome-with-potential-obstacles-can-help-create-a-sense-of-urgency-and-motivation">Idea 5: Mentally contrasting a desired outcome with potential obstacles can help create a sense of urgency and motivation</h2>
<p>Have you ever felt like you&rsquo;re stuck in a rut with no motivation or drive to achieve your goals? Perhaps you&rsquo;ve tried positive thinking, visualizing your success and all the good things that come with it, but still find yourself falling short.</p>
<p>Gabriele Oettingen has a solution: mentally contrasting your desired outcome with potential obstacles.</p>
<p>Now, you might be thinking, &ldquo;Wait, isn&rsquo;t positive thinking supposed to be all rainbows and sunshine? Why would I want to focus on the obstacles?&rdquo; Well, according to Oettingen, this technique can actually create a sense of urgency and motivation that positive thinking alone cannot.</p>
<p>The idea behind mental contrasting is simple: you visualize your desired outcome in detail, and then you identify the obstacles that might stand in your way. By mentally contrasting the two, you create &ldquo;tension&rdquo; that can propel you into action.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say your goal is to get a promotion at work. You start by visualizing yourself in the new position, imagining how great it will feel to have more responsibility, a higher salary, and more recognition from your colleagues.</p>
<p>But then, you also think about the obstacles that might stand in your way: maybe you don&rsquo;t have all the necessary skills yet, or maybe there are other candidates who are also vying for the same promotion.</p>
<p>By mentally contrasting your desired outcome with these potential obstacles, you create a sense of urgency and motivation to take action. You might start researching the skills you need to acquire or finding ways to differentiate yourself from the other candidates. This sense of urgency can help you stay focused and motivated, even when the going gets tough.</p>
<p>While this concept will be extremely valuable in helping you achieve your goals, it&rsquo;s not going to solve all your problems overnight, and it&rsquo;s not a substitute for hard work and dedication. But by combining mental contrast with positive thinking and other goal-setting techniques, you can create a powerful toolkit for achieving your goals.</p>
<p>Next time you&rsquo;re feeling stuck or unmotivated, try mental contrasting. Visualize your desired outcome, and then identify the obstacles that might stand in your way.</p>
<h2 id="idea-6-indulging-in-positive-fantasies-can-actually-decrease-motivation-and-make-it-less-likely-that-people-will-take-action-towards-their-goals">Idea 6: Indulging in positive fantasies can actually decrease motivation and make it less likely that people will take action towards their goals</h2>
<p>According to Oettingen, when people engage in positive fantasies about their future, they experience a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment, as if they have already achieved their goals. This creates a &ldquo;mental comfort zone&rdquo; that can be difficult to break out of, as people become complacent and lose their drive to take action towards their goals.</p>
<p>In contrast, people who engage in a more balanced and realistic form of thinking about their future are more motivated to take action and work towards their goals.</p>
<p>Oettingen&rsquo;s theory is based on a series of experiments she conducted over several decades that involved participants from various age groups and backgrounds. In one study, participants were asked to visualize their best possible future and then given a task to complete.</p>
<p>The results showed that those who engaged in positive fantasies performed worse on the task than those who engaged in more balanced and realistic thinking about their future.</p>
<p>Another study involved participants who were trying to lose weight. Those who engaged in positive fantasies about their weight loss journey were less likely to take action towards their goal than those who engaged in a more realistic form of thinking, which involved anticipating obstacles and coming up with strategies to overcome them.</p>
<p>Cool, huh? But what can we learn from Oettingen&rsquo;s research? Should we stop thinking positively altogether? Not necessarily. Oettingen suggests that there is a place for positive thinking, but it needs to be balanced with a more realistic and action-oriented approach. This involves acknowledging the obstacles and challenges that may arise on the way to achieving our goals and coming up with strategies to overcome them.</p>
<p>Need another example? No problem. Let&rsquo;s say that your goal is to start a new business. It&rsquo;s important to visualize your success and feel positive about it. However, it&rsquo;s equally important to acknowledge the potential challenges you may face, such as competition, financial constraints, and marketing difficulties. Anticipating these obstacles and coming up with strategies to overcome them will make you better equipped to take action and work towards your goal.</p>
<h2 id="who-is-the-book-rethinking-positive-thinking-by-gabriele-oettingen-recommended-for">Who is the book &ldquo;Rethinking Positive Thinking&rdquo; by Gabriele Oettingen recommended for?</h2>
<p>Well, if you&rsquo;re the type of person who believes that simply visualizing your goals and dreams is enough to make them a reality, then &ldquo;Rethinking Positive Thinking&rdquo; by Gabriele Oettingen is definitely for you.
